    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
        
        The DriverPass company was concerned that studnents taking the driver exams were not getting the necessary tools to help them succeed. This system is hoping to help provide students with access to online exams and quizzes that will help prepare them for their driver's tests. As well as one on one drivers tests with instructors that will help tutor them based on the current DMV guidelines and recommendations. The DriverPass system should be able to handle these needs. This would be best implemented as a web based system, having users access it through a web browser that can run on multiple different operating systems.
        
    What did you do particularly well?
        
        The things I did well when completing this project was creating important diagrams for the DriverPass system. I believe that my UML Use Case Diagram covers each actor within the system as well as covering each of the use cases that the actors will be able to do with this stystem for DriverPass. I also think that the Activity Diagram I created for the Login function as well as the Activity Diagram for the Learning Material encompasses exactly what each of the functions should consider as it works towards completion.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

        The parts of my work I would choose to revise would probably be the powerpoint presentation I created to help showcase the UML diagrams I created to show the stakeholders of the DriverPass company. AFter reviewing the syllabus it seemed that I had missed a few points in my presentation such as creating a doc. for my speaker notes (even though they were already attached to each slide so I figured it would be sufficient.), I guess I should have created a separate doc file even though it seems kind of redundant.
        
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
        
        I interpretted the user's needs and implemented them into my system design for the DriverPass System by first analyzing the DriverPass Interview Transcript. This included interview between representatives from your consulting company, Sam and Jennifer, and representatives from DriverPass. The transcript helps describe what they expect out of the system as well as the beginning of the foundation of what each user will do and how they will interact within the system.
        
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

    I approached desinging the software by first reviewing the Interview Transcript as I described just above. After reviewing the transcript I started to plan out each of the tasks needed to complete the system. I think some strategies that are important to consider when designing a system is to communicate effectively with the client to make sure that you are fully encompassing their vision for the system you will be designing for them. If their are any doubts when it comes to system it can slow down production and can create unnecessary roadblocks which can take up more time and money from the project.
